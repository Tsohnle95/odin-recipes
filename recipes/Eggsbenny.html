    <p>Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast menu item, and itâ€™s super easy to make
         from home! It starts with a toasted english muffin, topped with a slice or
          two of Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and smothered in traditional Eggs Benedict
           sauce, called hollandaise sauce.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 English Muffins</li>
      <li>4 Large eggs</li>
      <li>4 Slices Canadian bacon</li>
      <li>Vinegar, just a splash</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks.
             Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well.
                 Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.
                 ( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure 
                 they don't curdle).</li>
                <li>Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan.
                     Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat
                      and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash 
                      of cream, if needed, to thin.</li>
    </ol>
