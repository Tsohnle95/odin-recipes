<p>Ready for a slice of heaven? We are no stranger to decadent and rich cakes. But what about
    a cake recipe where butter, fat, and egg yolks run away in fright? Meet angel food cake. 
    Angel food cake is a low fat cake recipe made mostly from egg whites, cake flour, and sugar.
    It’s pristine white on the inside with a chewy light brown crumb around the exterior. What 
    it lacks in butter makes up for in texture. This tall, tender, and timeless cake has a cloud-
    like crumb and ultra light flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cake flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Egg whites</li>
        <li>Cream of Tartar</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pulse the granulated sugar into superfine sugar.</strong> Use a food processor or blender.</li>
        <li><strong>Set 1 cup of the superfine sugar aside.</strong> You'll add it to the egg whites.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cake flour and salt to food processor. Pulse them with the remaining sugar.</strong> This aerates
            the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Sift and fold in dry ingredients.</strong> In <em>3 additions</em>, sift and fold in the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake at 325°F (163°C). <strong>A higher temperature won’t properly cook the cake.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cool upside down on a wire rack.</strong> <em>If cooled upright, the cake’s own weight will crush itself.</em>
            Cool it upside-down on a cooling rack so it holds its shape and air can reach it.</li>
    </ol>
